1. Big Red Course Reviews
2. Lists CS courses at Cornell where users can read and leave their own reviews of the course
3. ios
4. add screenshots
5. Users can browse through classes, and click on one to see more information. There they can read reviews and leave one of their own.
6. ios idk, backend - http://bigredcoursereviews.herokuapp.com/ /api/courses/ to see all courses, /api/courses/id/ to see a specific course, /api/courses/id/reviews/ to leave a review. We have other routes that we did not end up using on the frontend and our backend has 3 tables that have relationships (classes, reviews, users(not used)).
7. We initially were making a marketplace app, which is why we have users and transaction routes. We later dicided to make a course reviews app and wanted to modify what we already had instead of starting over.
